## AI-Diet-Agent

A personalized AI diet recommendation agent powered by reinforcement learning and adaptive AI assistance.


## Project Overview

This project aims to build a personalized AI system that recommends daily diet plans based on user goals (e.g., fat loss, muscle gain), physical parameters, and historical behavior. The system simulates economic decision-making under constraints (satisfaction, health targets, and calorie budget), integrates reinforcement learning to optimize recommendations, and uses a large language model (LLM) to generate interpretable suggestions.
